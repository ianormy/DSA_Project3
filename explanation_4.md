# Dutch National Flag Problem
I have implemented this using an inplace sort with pointers and a single pass through
the items.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of going through the items in the list once is O(n).

## Space Complexity
Space complexity is O(n) which is the original items of the list and O(1) for
the pointers.

Total space complexity: O(n)

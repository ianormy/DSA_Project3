# Max and Min in an Unsorted Array
I have implemented this in a single pass by updating the min and max values
as I iterate over all the items.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this operation is O(n).

## Space Complexity
Space complexity is O(n) for the unsorted array and O(1) to store the min
and max values.

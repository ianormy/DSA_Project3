# Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
I have implemented this using binary search algorithms to find 
the pivot point and the value.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n).

## Space Complexity
Space complexity is O(1) since we are only using constant space
and simply moving pointers.
